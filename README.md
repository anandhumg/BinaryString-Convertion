Given a binary string consisting of characters '0's and '1', the following operation can be 

performed on it:

â€¢ [String Conversion.pdf](https://github.com/mg7530/String-Convertion/files/13523840/String.Conversion.pdf)
Choose two adjacent characters, and replace both the characters with their 

bitwise XOR value. For example, if binaryStr = "1100" and the first two characters are 

chosen, then after one operation, the string becomes binaryStr = "0000".

The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to convert all characters of the 

string to '0'.
